# Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

## Basics

HTML is used to create the basic structure of a web page. What elements and how many will be present in the page are marked with HTML. HTML consists of tags, attributes and contents. Tags denote what will be present in a page while attributes add additional information about the tags. Contents are the actual things that are visible inside the page.
